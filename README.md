# Tabs-to-Spaces
##Program that edits files to replace tabs with spaces

- Requires only Python 3 builtins. Runs on Python 3 only.
- Asks for the path to your file, how many spaces each tab should be replaced with, and if it should save a copy.
- Changes may not be made if the file is being edited elsewhere.
- Can be used with Python 2 if the `input()` functions are replaced with `raw_input`. `print()` should be changed to a statement.

This was made for instances where a text editor may not have an "untabify" feature, like Nano.
I am a beginner, and this was meant more for practice than utility.
